## My process

I used vanilla html and css for this project. Firstly, I started by laying out the html tags to use. Then, I linked a css
file to style all the elements.

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned a little bit about media queries to make this project responsive for mobile and medium-sized devices.

```css
@media screen and (max-width: 48rem) {
    main {
        padding: 2.5rem;
    }

    .container {
        width: 28.5rem;
    }
}

@media screen and (max-width: 23.4375rem) {
    main {
        padding: 1.5rem;
    }

    .container {
        max-width: 20.4375rem;
        padding: 1.5rem;
    }
}
```

I don't quite know if this was the right way to go about it, but that's what I came up with.

### Continued development

I'd refine the media queries in the future especially for mobile, but this is a great start.

### Useful resources

-   [Resource on Media Queries](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_mediaqueries.asp) - This helped me think about how I wanted to layout my media queries at the end of my css file.
